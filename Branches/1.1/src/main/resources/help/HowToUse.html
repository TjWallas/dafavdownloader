<h2>How to Use</h2>
<center><img src="images/Main.png"/><br/></center>
<p>
<b>DeviantArt Favorites Downloader</b> is easy to use. Configure your username, set the download locations and hit download. Or use the default if you don't mind the download location and if your operating username is the same as your deviantART username. 
</p>
<p>However, you can customize your settings in order to order your favorites the ways you want.<br/>
Some of the customization include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the download path to include deviation details such as the artist name, the deviation name, etc,</li>
<li>Downloading deviation and mature deviation into different directories,</li>
<li>The Look and Feel of the interface,</li>
</ul>
See the preferences section for more explanations on those functionalities.
</p>

<p>
After you've configured your preferences, you can save them as default by selecting '<i>Save Session as Default</i>' from the '<i>File</i>' menu. Those setting will be automatically loaded when you restart the application.<br/>
If you want to keep different profiles, for example, a profile for your favorites and one for your club favorites, you can save and load those settings using respectively the '<i>Save Session</i>' and '<i>Open Session</i>' from the '<i>File</i>' menu.
</p>

<p>
A preview of the download location is displayed in '<i>Location</i>' bar. If a previous download has been interrupted, you can skip those by increasing the '<i>Skip</i>' spinner box. Favorites are fetched by batch of <b>24</b>, so the spinner will only increase by multiple of <b>24</b>.
</p>
<p>When ready, hit download. You'll see 2 progress bars: one for the current download and one for the total progress. Depending on the amount of favorites you have and your Internet connection, it can take some time. After the initial download, it is recommended to stop the process once it start skipping files to avoid overloading deviantART's servers. A reminder will pop-up after the first <b>480</b> skipped favorites.</p>

<p>
You can download your 'clean' and 'mature' deviations in different directories. If you want to use your favorites for your screen savers, wallpapers or slide show, having the mature favorites saved elsewhere could be a life saver should some 'not as respectable' pictures were to be shown.
