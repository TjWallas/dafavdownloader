<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<b>DeviantArt Favorites Downloader</b> is a small utility I coded to help manage the various deviations I added to my favorites over the years. 
deviantArt is a nice gallery with many useful features, one of which is to bookmarks your favorite arts.
</p>
<p>
However, like many WEB 2.0 websites, all the feature must be used online. If the site goes off-line for maintenance, if a person get banned or decide to close their account, you cannot retrieves what you've added to your favorites. 
You can manually download the deviations for safe keeping, but this can be a tedious task if you have accumulated many favorites.
</p>
<p>
This little utility, written in Java for portability, target this issue. deviantArt expose a search API for all of its page generation. While not officially published, it has been mentionned the deviantArt doesn't mind people using the API.
