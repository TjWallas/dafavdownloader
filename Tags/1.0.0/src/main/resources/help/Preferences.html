<b>DeviantArt Favorites Downloader</b> can be customized in order to better fit your sorting habits. 
</p>

<h3>Username</h3>
<p>
This control which user's favorite you're downloading. For most usage, it will be your own deviantART username, but if you want to download someone's else favorites or a club favorites, you can input their username there. 
</p>

<h3>Download Location</h3>
<p>
This control where the 'clean' deviations will be saved to. You can build any path as long as the drive exists and you don't use forbidden characters. You can customize path using informations from the downloaded deviation by substituting their field inside the path. The fields are listed bellow. A sample path is showed in the example field at the bottom.  
</p>
<h3>Mature Download Location</h3>
<p>
This control where the 'mature' deviations will be saved to. Should you want to save those deviations elsewhere, safety, privacy, usage or any reasons, you can specify it there. If you don't mind having both clean and matures deviations saved in the same destination, input the same path or check the '<i>Use same location for mature deviation</i>' box. A sample path is showed in the example field at the bottom.
</p>
<h2>Fields</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>%user%</b> The user's username whose favorites are being downloaded. Same as inputed in the username box above,</li>
<li><b>%artist%</b> The username of person who has submitted the deviation being saved,</li>
<li><b>%title%</b> The deviation's title, aka the '<i>Deviation Title</i>'. The title is normalized to remove any forbidden characters,</li>
<li><b>%id%</b> The deviation's id, example 123456789,</li>
<li><b>%filename%</b> The deviation's filename,</li>
<li><b>%ext%</b> The deviation's filename extension</li>
</ul>
<p>
At least one of the supplied field must be supplied: %id%, %filename%.
</p>
<h3>Throttling</h3>
<p>
The application doesn't download files that have already been downloaded. When performing a rerun, this mean files will be skipped and deviantART will be contacted over and over for favorites updates. To lessen the load, a delay between search can be configured.  If the delay between searches are less than 10 seconds, a pause is performed for as many seconds specified here.
